1. Project Overview 

This project is a realistic insulin pump simulator modeled after the Tandem t:slim X2 pump. It mimics the actual user experience of managing diabetes through CGM data, insulin boluses, and automated control algorithms.

The purpose of this simulator is: 
- To simulate real-time glucose readings. 
- To allow for manual and automated insulin delivery. 
- To ensure safety through warning checks (low BG, insulin, battery). 
- To provide interactive user profiles with editable insulin parameters. 
- To track all activity via a comprehensive event history log. 

2. Core Features 

Real-Time CGM Simulation:	       Background simulation of blood glucose using a timer (1 sec = 5 minutes sim time). 
Manual & Extended Bolus Delivery:Users can enter carbs, BG, and IOB for calculated insulin dose. 
Control IQ Automation:	         Automated insulin delivery or suspension based on projected glucose. 
Warning System:	                 Monitors insulin level less than 4U, battery if battary less than 5% , and glucose every 30 seconds. 
User Profiles:                   Create, edit, and delete. 
History Tracking:	               Logs every bolus, BG reading, and warning alert with timestamps.

4. Key Components & Class Descriptions: 

ðŸ”· MainWindow 
- Central hub that creates the layout (battery/insulin bars, navigation, graph). 
- Connects major modules like PumpController, CgmSimulator, etc. 
- Opens modal dialogs for bolus, profile, history, and alerts. 

ðŸ”· PumpController 
- Mediator pattern that routes logic between bolus entry, CGM data, and insulin safety. 
- Implements Control IQ logic to predict BG 30 mins ahead and act accordingly. 
- Records insulin events through the HistoryManager. 

ðŸ”· CgmSimulator 
- Timer-based simulation that updates BG every second (5 simulated minutes). 
- Uses random walk or sinusoidal algorithm to emulate real glucose variability. 
- Emits bgUpdated(double) signal to any subscriber (graph, controller). 

ðŸ”· BolusDeliveryWidget 
- Allows input of carbs, insulin on board (IOB), and BG. 
- Offers manual BG or CGM BG options. 
- Supports extended bolus delivery (portion over time). 
- Performs insulin dose suggestion using formula: 
- Suggested Dose = (Carbs / CarbRatio) + (BG - Target) / CorrectionFactor - IOB.
  
ðŸ”· BolusSafetyManager 
Ensures: 
- Max single bolus not exceeded. 
- Max daily total not breached. 
- Cooldown time (e.g. 30 min) respected. 
- Works with user profile values. 

ðŸ”· UserProfileManager / UserProfile 
- Handles multiple user configurations with: 
- carbRatio, correctionFactor, targetBG, basalRate 
- Custom thresholds for low/high BG 

ðŸ”· WarningChecker 
- Timer runs every 30 seconds to check: 
- Battery level < 5% 
- Insulin reservoir < 4 units 
- BG too high (> 14.0 mmol/L) or too low (< 3.9 mmol/L) 
- Creates WarningRecord and triggers pop-up dialog. 

ðŸ”· HistoryManager / HistoryDialog 
- Logs all major actions: CGM readings, bolus events, warnings. 
- Each event contains timestamp, type, insulin amount, source (manual/auto). 
- Filterable by date or event type in HistoryDialog. 

ðŸ”· CGMGraphWidget 
- Live BG graph using QChartView (1h, 3h, 6h ranges). 
- Smooth animations and dynamic axes. 


5. Build and Run Instructions 

ðŸ“Œ Using Qt Creator (Recommended) 
1. Open TandemInsulinPumpSimulator.pro 
2. Press Build then Run 

ðŸ§ª Using Terminal (qmake or cmake) 

# Clone the repository 
git clone https://github.com/abdelmesihchristine/TandemInsulinPumpSimulator.git 
cd pumpsimulator 

# QMake 
qmake TandemInsulinPumpSimulator.pro 
make 

# Run the executable

ðŸ”˜ Main Interface: 
- See battery, insulin reservoir, CGM graph, time. 

ðŸ’‰ Bolus: 
- Click Bolus â†’ Select Manual BG or CGM BG 
- Input carbs, BG, and IOB â†’ Click Calculate then Deliver 

ðŸ‘¤ Profiles: 
- Click Profiles â†’ Add/Edit/Delete user configurations

7. System Design Principles 

ðŸ“Œ Observer Pattern: 
CGM simulator uses Qt signals to notify PumpController and CGMGraphWidget of new BG readings. 
Decouples components and enables event-driven updates. 

ðŸ“Œ Mediator Pattern: 
PumpController acts as a central coordinator between managers (Safety, History, User Profile, CGM). 
Reduces direct dependencies between components. 

ðŸ“Œ Encapsulation: 
Each manager class (e.g., BolusSafetyManager, UserProfileManager, HistoryManager) manages its own responsibilities. 
Improves modularity, readability, and maintainability. 

ðŸ“Œ Extensibility: 
Design allows easy addition of new features (e.g., exercise mode, sleep mode, new export formats). 
Supports future growth without major code rewrites.
